# It just generates a range of numbers, copies them to the clipboard and opens up a website for work

Basically every couple of weeks I need to verify invoices were sent to Amazon, which are sent in sequential batches from anywhere between 10 and 40 consecutive invoices and therefore numbers. Instead of manually going to Amazon, writing each number in the search box in the given format I thought this would save me some time. It takes two values (doesn't matter if you enter the high first or the low first), generates the numbers between inclusive, copies them to my clipboard, and automatically opens up the invoice center on Amazon. Then I can just paste. Takes like 10 seconds max.

The previous Amazon experience used newlines exclusively, the current one lets you separate using newline, comma or spaces so I made that configurable. This is currently my only good use case but if I encounter anything else then I'll change it idk
